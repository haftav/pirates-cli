# CLI PIRATES

This is a pirates command line game. Its functionality is pretty rudimentary. At the moment, the player's only available movement is 5 units to the left each time. The only other thing you can do is end the game.

I'll be updating this as I can and I hope to turn it into something pretty involved. I'm curious about the possibilities and limitations of command line interfaces and thought this could be a cool experiment to learn and play around with various patterns.
