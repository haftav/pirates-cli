# CLI PIRATES

This is a pirates command line game. Its functionality is pretty basic. The only actions you can take at this point are moving the player and ending the game.

I'll be updating this as I can and I hope to turn it into something pretty involved. I'm curious about the possibilities and limitations of command line interfaces and thought this could be a cool experiment to learn and play around with various patterns.
