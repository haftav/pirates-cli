# CLI PIRATES

### This is a pirates command line game I'm building out. It's still in a fairly rudimentary phase.

I'll be updating this as I can and I hope to turn it into something pretty involved. I'm curious about the possibilities and limitations of command line interfaces and thought this could be a cool experiment to learn and play around with various patterns.
